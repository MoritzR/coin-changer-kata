# Coin Changer kata with property based testing

> Given a list of coins and an amount, find a combination of coins that adds up to the amount as close as possible.
The combination of coins should use the fewest coins possible.
Return the combination of coins and the leftover amount.

Implement the Coin Changer program and cover it with tests.

You are only allowed to write property based tests using Haskell's [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) library.

### Run the tests

You can run the tests provided in this example project with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org):

```
> stack test
...        
Prelude.reverse
  reversing a String twice yields the original String
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
